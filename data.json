            "Some exciting personal and professional news! Most of you know that I\u2019ve been looking for a partner to help me scale Reonomy into a company of consequence for over 8 years now. When I managed to convince Bill Okun to step into the business full-time after two years on our Board, I hoped that he would be the partner that I\u2019ve been looking for. Over the last few quarters, that hope has been replaced by absolute conviction and certainty that Bill is the right partner to help us on the amazing journey that we are on at Reonomy.That\u2019s why I am thrilled to announce that I am stepping up to a new full-time role as Executive Chairman, with Bill assuming the role of CEO. I\u2019ve known Bill for almost 7 years (thanks for the intro Brooks Gibbins and Gareth Jones!) and I know that he will do a fantastic job focusing on daily execution and management of the team while I focus on our clients, strategy and partnerships.Thanks Bill and look forward to all that we\u2019ll accomplish together!Come join us!  :)",
